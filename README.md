# The-Science-Behind-Winning-a-Game-of-League-of-Legends
A data science process to review the science behind winning a game of league of legends

## Installation
This should be functional with basic python as long as you have numpy, pandas, and matplotlib libraries installed.

## Project Motivation
For this project I was interested in reviewing data from the game League of Legends and seeing what it takes to win a game at a high level. The top level of this game has millions of dollars in prizepool and reviewing the data within the game has become its own million dollar industry.
My questions were as follows:
1. How often does first blood lead to a gold lead at 10?
2. How many kills at 10 minutes do you need to be likely to win?
3. Which factors correlates the highest with a win?
The full data for this is is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min?select=high_diamond_ranked_10min.csv).

## File Descriptions
There is one notebook attatched that will showcase the work to asnwer the three questions above.

## Results
The results of the code can be found [here](https://medium.com/@grantdowns/the-science-behind-winning-a-game-of-league-of-legends-6c22e3a828a9).
